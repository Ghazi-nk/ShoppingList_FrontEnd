## Overview

The Shopping List App is a powerful and user-friendly checklist application designed to streamline your shopping experience.
It simplifies the process of creating, managing, and sharing your shopping lists.
No more forgetting items or feeling overwhelmed at the store â€“ our app has got you covered!

## Very Important:
##### We regret to inform you that due to unforeseen technical challenges, we were unable to configure the self-registration feature in our app as originally planned. As a result, we have taken the initiative to add your official university email addresses to our Okta system.

##### Here's what you need to know:

* You will receive an activation email from Okta to your official university email address.


* Once your Okta account is activated, you will be able to log in to our app using your credentials.
We understand that this may cause some inconvenience, and we sincerely apologize for any disruption this may cause to your experience. Our team is here to assist you throughout the process, and we are committed to ensuring a smooth transition.

##### If you encounter any confusion, problems, or have questions during the account activation process, please do not hesitate to contact us. We will be readily available to provide any assistance you may require.

Thank you for your understanding, and we appreciate your patience as we work to resolve this matter. We look forward to providing you with an excellent user experience on our app.

#### This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
